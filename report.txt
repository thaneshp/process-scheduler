CS-REPORT
1. My CS-algorithm is an implementation of shortest job first.
Essentially, this algorithm compares all processes that have arrived and 
sorts them in ascending order based on their running time. It then executes
the process with the shortest time first.

2. It performs better than the baselines when all other processes arrive 
within the time it takes to complete the first. The remaining processes 
should also have lower running times.

3. It does not perform as well when there are long processes to 
be executed. Processes with long running times may have to wait for shorter 
processes to be executed first, increasing wait times.


CM-REPORT
1. My CM-algorithm is an implementation of Most Recently Used algorithm. 
Unlike LRU, this algorithm works by evicting the pages in memory which have been 
assigned the most recently.

2. It performs better than baselines specifically when there are old processes 
likely to be accessed more frequently. This way these pages can be accessed later
without having to evict and re-load pages.

3. It does not perform as well when running time and memory requirements are low or similar
to each other. In these cases it performs similar to the baselines at best.
